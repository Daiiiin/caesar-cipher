# Caesar Cipher

This project is a Python implementation of the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption-decryption algorithm.

## How the Caesar Cipher Works
- The Caesar cipher shifts the letters in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- The same process is used for both encryption and decryption, but with reverse shifts for decryption.
- Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.) are not altered.
- The user specifies the shift number, and the algorithm shifts each letter by that many positions.

## Objective
- The goal is to implement a basic encryption-decryption mechanism using the Caesar cipher technique.

## Exercise Information
- This project is part of the exercises from the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** on Udemy.

## How to Use
- Run the program in your Python environment.
- Input a message and specify the shift number.
- The program will either encrypt or decrypt the message based on user input.
